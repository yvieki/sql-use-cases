## 🧠 Why this project?

Modern organizations run on data. But to make data truly useful, we need:
- Clear logic
- Reliable structures
- Actionable metrics

This project combines SQL skills with business-relevant thinking. It reflects my background in IT service management, BI development, and structured process design.
